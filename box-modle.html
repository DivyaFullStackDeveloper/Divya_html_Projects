            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈəbdʊl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian
            aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and
            raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent
            the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
            India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as
            the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]
